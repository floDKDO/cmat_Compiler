# cmat Compiler

This compiler can compile a subset of the C language and also handles operations on matrices.

This compiler was written in C using Flex and Bison.

## Capabilities
- *int* and *float* types and casts between these two types
- integer and floating-point constant declarations
- arithmetic operators specified in "cmat.lex"
- if with or without else, while and for loops
- variable redeclarations
- 1 and 2-dimensional arrays
- *matrix* type with the following operations :
  - addition and subtraction between two matrices
  - transposition of a matrix
  - multiplication and division of a matrix by a constant
  - operations with constants
  - the unary operators -, ++ and --


## Usage

### Compilation
- *make* creates an executable named "cmat". To run the program, type "./cmat"
- *make clean* deletes all files created by Flex and Bison, the .o files, the "./cmat" executable and the files generated by *make doc*
- *make doc* creates two useful files :
  - "cmat.output" which contains the list of terminal and non-terminal symbols, the grammar and the states
  - "cmat.pdf" which creates a graphical diagram of the states

### Execution
- *./cmat* launches the compiler. You can type the desired input in the terminal
- *./cmat < tests/test_x* launches the compiler with the file "test_x" (located in the "tests" folder) as input
